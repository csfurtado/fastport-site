# ?? Fastport Site

This repository contains the frontend for **Fastport**, a public-facing website that displays project reports and visual assets generated by the [`fastport-project`](https://github.com/csfurtado/fastport-project). The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is published via GitHub Pages.

## ?? Live Site

Visit the published site:  
**[https://csfurtado.github.io/fastport-site/](https://csfurtado.github.io/fastport-site/)**

## ?? Report Viewer

The `report.html` page is designed to load and display JSON reports dynamically. To use it:

1. Place a report file (e.g. `report.json`) inside a folder like `assets/reports/`
2. Update `script.js` to fetch and render the report
3. Open `report.html` in the browser to view the data

## ?? Integration with `fastport-project`

The backend project (`fastport-project`) can:

- Generate JSON reports or other assets
- Copy them into `site/assets/reports/`
- Optionally commit and push updates to GitHub

This keeps the site updated with the latest project insights.

## ?? Integration with `fastport-comments`

This site is also designed to integrate with [`fastport-comments`](https://github.com/csfurtado/fastport-comments), a module that enables user feedback and commentary on reports.

- Comments can be embedded below each report
- JavaScript logic can be extended to fetch and display comment threads
- Future versions may support moderation and threaded replies

## ?? Development Workflow

To run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csfurtado/fastport-site.git
cd fastport-site
open site/index.html
